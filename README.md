- 👋 Hi, I’m @CuriosParrot

-  👀 I’m interested in the connections between modern technology and law.
- As a hobby, I engage in programming, pentesting, and ethical hacking.
- I'm particularly focused on raising awareness about cybersecurity among people in my community.
-
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Flipper ZERO.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who can help me develop my IT skills or enrich me with insights related to pentesting and using the Flipper Zero.

- 📫 How to reach me DM on GitHUB or e-mail: mmmmzzzz1805@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He /Sir.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Despite having a humanities-oriented mind, I love computer science, in which I have already achieved several successes.
- For example, I created a virtual legal assistant for legal analysis based on a publicly available LLM.
